Contributions
=============

All contribution is encouraged!

Especially those to documentation and tests, but can be as simple as a feature
request in the issue tracker.

Setting up for development can be as simple as::

  $ source run.sh activate

Then running the tests::

  > ./test.sh

  OR

  > tox

And formatting/lint::

  > ./format
  > ./lint
